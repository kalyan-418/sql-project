Project: Library Management System

Description:
Create a database system to manage a library's resources, including books, borrowers, loans, and library branches. This system will allow librarians to track books, manage loans, and handle inventory across multiple branches.

Key Features:

Book Management: Store information about books including ISBN, title, author, genre, and availability status.
Borrower Management: Manage borrower details such as ID, name, contact information, and borrowing history.
Loan Management: Track loans by recording loan ID, borrower ID, book ID, loan date, due date, and return status.
Library Branches: Maintain information about library branches, including branch ID, name, address, and contact details.
Inventory Management: Keep track of the number of copies of each book available at each branch and update inventory as books are borrowed and returned.
Reporting: Generate reports such as overdue books, most borrowed books, borrower history, and inventory status.
Tasks for Interview:

Design the database schema with appropriate tables, relationships, and constraints.
Implement the database schema in a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Write SQL queries to perform common tasks such as adding books, managing loans, updating inventory, and generating reports.
Optimize the database schema and queries for performance and scalability.
Discuss potential improvements or additional features that could be added to the library management system.
